# leetcodeBank
This is a bank of Leetcode problems grouped according to their solution approach. In general, questions will belong to the category 
of their most optimal solution, but there may be some duplicates (same question in multiple categories).

In each section, we provide a description of the general approach. Questions and their solutions can be found under the Question Bank 
subsections.
